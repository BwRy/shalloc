Library containing a number of modular memory allocators. Contains support for a
number of different types of allocators which can be combined. Furthermore,
shalloc supports allocators in shared memory, meaning any process attached to
this memory can malloc/free, visible to all other processes.

Licenses: note that most allocators in this projects are pre-existing/external
projects.  As such, these projects have different licenses than shalloc itself.
